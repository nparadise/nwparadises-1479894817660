In fact most people say that the flavors have blended better on the second day... If in the strange case that you are filled up with one pie, this is a great gift to give a friend or relative, or if you are stingy...it freezes well with tin foil.",

The presentation is excellent! You can shorten the preparation time by using apple pie filling, but the crisp of new apples really makes it.",

This bread is also excellent if you add mini chocolate chips or small fruit pieces to the mix just before baking.",
