I also wanted to try escarole in a soup, and the result was fantastic. Adzuki beans are found in any health food or specialty store, and in many national grocery chains. They have a great nutty, slightly sweet taste, and are especially tasty added to chicken soups of any kind.\" Added to shopping list. Go to shopping list."
